M, L, and I got dinner together. Mercurios Pizza isn't open on Mondays or
Tuesdays so we went to Fujiya Ramen. M got a Katsu Don; L got a Chashu Don; I
got a Katsu Curry. Then we got matcha desserts from めっちゃ抹茶, L and M
shared an ice cream from Rita's, and we walked back.

I got a celsius packet at the start of the day (3PM ish) and then a 255mg
matcha at MM, and for some reason it only served to make me unable to think.
Dissociative. Void. **I've decided to start tracking a streak of having less
than 100mg caffeine per day.**

A6 and us played MarioKart and SmashBros. My main used to be Marth/Lucina but I
tried Pit which is a very directional character: almost everything can be
aimed. It was fun but nothing super noteworthy.

L sent us a message saying they plan \*\*\*. M and I are somewhat concerned.

M cleaned up, did laundry, and packed. **I planned packing and discussed
travelling with M and my dad, and rented a storage space, and got to crash at
L's.** No further progress on gup GIF or arts.

Oh yes M toasted a pop tart for me; he hasn't had his own share yet. I'll ask
him to get his share. —4AM, 7th.
