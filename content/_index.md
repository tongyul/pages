# Meoww~ from Rain :3

Haiii!! I'm Rain — I mean, we're Rain... I, uh, we, are, probably(?) plural(?)
...? Gahhh just forget about it.

But yeah, I'm trans *(she/they/any)* and prolly audhd; I code; sometimes I
draw. I'm also trying to learn to play acoustic guitar. I'm also uhhh in some
academic trouble? I'm interested in programming languages and hyperfixate on
thinking about stuff completely unrelated from school (beyond course scopes)
every single day and I'm in a lot of misery for that.
