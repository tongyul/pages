# Meoww~ from Rain :3

**Haiii!! I'm Rain** — I mean, we're Rain... I, uh, we, are, probably(?)
plural(?) ...? Gahhh just forget about it. This is my *homepage* [^zola] and
it's *w.i.p.* :3 (The current progress mostly consists of adding features to
the theme.)

But yeah, *I'm trans* (she/they/any) and *prolly audhd*; *I code*; sometimes *I
draw* or *take photos*. I also just started learning to play *acoustic guitar*.
I'm also uhhh in some academic trouble? I'm interested in programming languages
and hyperfixate on thinking about stuff completely unrelated from school
(beyond course scopes) every single day and I'm in a lot of misery for that.

[^zola]: Built with [Zola](https://getzola.org) using my own theme
